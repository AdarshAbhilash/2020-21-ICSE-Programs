1) Write a menu driven class to accept a number from the
user and check whether it is a Palindrome or a Perfect
number.
(a) Palindrome number- (a number is a Palindrome which
when read in reverse order is same as read in the right
order) Example: 11, 101, 151, etc.
(b) Perfect number- (a number is called perfect if it is
equal to the sum of its factors other than the number
itself.) Example: 6=1+2+3

2. Define a class named BookFair with the following
description:
Instance variables/Data members:
String Bname – stores the name of the book.
double price – stores the price of the book.
Member Methods:
(i) void Input() – To input and store the name and the price
of the book.
(ii) void calculate() – To calculate the price after discount.
Discount is calculated based on the following criteria:
PRICE DISCOUNT
Less than or equal to ` 1000 2% of
price
More than ` 1000 and less than or equal or ` 3000
10% of price
More than ` 3000 15% of price
(iii) void display() – To display the name and price of the
book after discount.
Write a main method to create an object of the class and
call the above member methods.

3. Write a class with the name volume using function
overloading that computes the volume of a cube, a
sphere and a cuboid.
Formula: volume of a cube (vc) = s*s*s
volume of a sphere (vs) = 4/3 * pi * r * r * r (where pi =
3.14 or 22/7)
Volume of a cuboid (vcd) = l * b * h
